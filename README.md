## For CS4487 Machine Learning Group Project
The project is based on the kaggle link stated above. The main task for the project is to do binary classification on cactus aerial images. Instead of using the original validation set for validation, the project uses validation set as test set while training set can be splitted into training and validation.
We have achieved an accuracy of 99.9% with the cnn we built. As for the job distribution, I am in charge of PCA, SVD, Random Forest, CNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
